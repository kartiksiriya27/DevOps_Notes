What will happen when we turn on the computer ?

Power on → Electricity flows.
BIOS/UEFI starts → Runs POST checks.
Bootloader loads → Finds OS.
Operating system loads → Initializes drivers & services.
User logs in → System is ready to use.

Linux folder Structure 

In Linux, the filesystem follows a hierarchical structure where all directories and files originate from the root directory (/). Below is an overview of the key directories:


Summary of Key Directories
Directory	Purpose
/	Root directory (base of the filesystem)
/bin	Essential command binaries
/sbin	System administration binaries
/etc	System-wide configuration files
/home	User home directories
/root	Home directory for the root user
/var	Log files and system data
/tmp	Temporary files
/usr	User binaries, libraries, documentation
/lib	Shared system libraries
/dev	Device files (disks, printers, etc.)
/mnt & /media	Mount points for external storage
/opt	Third-party applications
/proc & /sys	Virtual filesystems for system and process info
/boot	Bootloader and kernel files
/srv	Service-related files

 ext (Extended File System)
First introduced in 1992.
The first filesystem designed specifically for Linux.
Had many limitations, including poor performance and lack of key features like journaling.

2. ext2 (Second Extended File System)
Introduced in 1993.
Improved performance over ext.
Does NOT support journaling, meaning after a crash, the system needs to perform a full filesystem check.
Used in USB drives and SD cards due to its simplicity and low overhead.

3. ext3 (Third Extended File System)
Introduced in 2001.
Added journaling, reducing the risk of data loss during crashes.
Backward compatible with ext2 (can be mounted as ext2 if journaling is disabled).
Not as fast as other modern file systems.

4. ext4 (Fourth Extended File System)
Introduced in 2008.
Supports larger file sizes (up to 16 TB) and larger volumes (up to 1 EB).
More efficient storage allocation with delayed allocation and multi-block allocation.
Backward compatible with ext3 and ext2.
Faster and more reliable than ext3, making it the default Linux filesystem in most distributions.

Which One Should You Use?
ext2: Best for USB drives and SD cards (to reduce write operations).
ext3: Only if you're working with an old Linux system.
ext4: Recommended for modern Linux systems due to performance and reliability
