Maven life-cycle phase 
	• Validate: Check if the project is correct, having all the necessary information 
          $mvn validate 
	• Compile: It compiles the source code of the project 
          $mvn compile 
	• test: test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework -these tests should not required the code to be packaged or deployed 
          mvn test 
	• Package: task the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR 
          mvn package 
	• Integration-test: process and deploy the package into an environment where integration test can be run 
          mvn integration-test 
	• Verify: run any checks to verify the package is valid and meets quality criteria 
          mvn verify 
	• Install: install the package into the local repo for use as a dependency in other projects locally 
          mvn install
	• Deploy: done in an integration or release environment copies the final packages to the remote repositories for sharing with other developer and projects 
          mvn deploy 


I] What is .m2 folder ? 
.m2 folder is a folder in a local repositories and apache maven where dependency and plugin is stored 

So apache maven has a advantage that is when we run any of the life-cycle phase which is also includes previous life cycle phase as well 
E.g: If we run "mvn package" (which is 4th phase) we should also run previous phase as well (validate, compile, test)
