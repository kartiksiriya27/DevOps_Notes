       • Manage Jenkins --> Security --> users 
       • Select the user you want to reset then on the left side you can see security then you can see the password 
         then their you can change the password and click on save then 

As a administration you can change the password you need to inform to the user saying please follow below steps to change password

    2] Slave, Nodes, Agents these terminology are same in Jenkins 



Jenkins Folder 

       • In windows os we can see all Jenkins information and configuration detail under 
         Path 

       • C:\programData\Jenkins\.jenkins 

       • under Jenkins folder we can see users folder (all the Jenkins user data available)
       
Workspace

Nodes

       •  Where all the configured nodes are available 

Logs 

       •  We can see Slaves (If configured) and tasks logs are available 

Apart from the above folder their is Jenkins configuration file name as config.Xml (if at all changing a config.xml file first take the backup of the file or copy that xml file some where else)

We can also see the Jenkins log in Jenkins

Look for Webhooks in GIT 

Ways to trigger the jobs ?

       • The are 5 types 

1] Trigger builds remotely (e.g., from scripts)

       •  In order to use this trigger 1st we need to generate thee authentication token of the job 

       •  Example for the feature 
       •  Enable this option if you would like to trigger new builds by accessing a special predefined URL (convenient for scripts).
       •  You'll need to provide an authorization token in the form of a string so that only those who know it would be able to remotely trigger this project's builds.
       •  This is most useful when your Jenkins instance grants read access to this job to anonymous users.
       •  When that's not the case, Jenkins will reject requests sent to the trigger URL even when the correct token is specified

use the following URL to trigger build remotely 
       •  Jenkins.URL/job/ajafreestyle/build?token=TOKENNAME or/buildwithparameters?token=TOKEN_NAME 

2] Build after other projects are built
   (upstream and downstream jobs)

       •  Set up a trigger so that when some other projects finish building, a new build is scheduled for this project. This is convenient for running an extensive test after 
          a build is complete, for example.

          we need to pass the job name (which are configuration already) under project to watch tab
 
       • Trigger only if build is stable
       • Trigger even if the build is unstable 
       • Trigger even if the build fails 
       • Always trigger even if the build is aborted

3] Build periodically 
   (If Schedule)

       • This field follows the syntax of cron (with minor difference) Specially, each line consist of 5 field separated by TAB whitespace

       • MINUTE HOUR DOM MONTH DOW


       • MINUTE  - minutes within the hour (0-59)
       • HOUR    - the hour of the day (0-23)
       • DOM     - The day of the month (1-31)
       • MONTH   - The Month (1-12)
       • DOW     - The day of the week (0-7) when 0 and 7 are Sunday 1 is Monday

To specify multiple value for one field the following operators are available in the order of precedence

For reference or practice go with the website crontab.guru


4] GitHub hook trigger for Git SCM polling 

       • When Jenkins receives a GitHub push hook, GitHub Plugin checks to see whether the hook came from a GitHub repository which matches the Git repository defined in SCM/Git
         section of this job.

5] Poll SCM

       • Apart from the above 5 trigger way you can also trigger jobs Manually
