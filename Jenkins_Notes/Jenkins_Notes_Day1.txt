I] Importance of continuous Integration
 
    1) Improves Quality   
     • Improves the quality by running multiple unit tests and analysing various static code 

    2) Increase Productivity 
     • Automating build of code save lot of time, thereby increasing pro 

    3) Reduce Risk 
     • Eliminate the risk of potential human errors by automating test


II] Introduction to Jenkins 
     
    1) Features of Jenkins 
     • Easy Installation process   
     • Upgrades are easily available 
     • Provides advance security 
     • Lightweight container support 
     • Optimized performance 
     • Distributed Team management 

III] What is continuous Integration ? 
     
     • It is the process of automating the building and testing of code, each time one of the team member commits change to version control

I- Integration
C- Continuous 
D- Deployment/Delivery is also know as release 

                                     Source                       
                  commit            control            Initiate c1 process   


                Development                                   Build 


                   Report            Testing              Test 


IV] Popular continuous Integration Tools 

    •Gitlab CI 
    •Codeship 
    •Bamboo
    •Jenkins 
    •Teamcity 
    •Travis CI



From AWS cloud if we want to perform CICD there are various services like code commit, code deploy and code guru and code pipeline as well 

For Azure cloud we have Azure DevOps, Azure Boards, Azure Repos, Azure Testplans and Azure Artifacts 


V] What is Jenkins ?
   • A continuous Integration (and automation server) manages and controller processes such as plane, code, build, test, deploy, operate and monitor in DevOps Environment.

                  PLAN                             DEPLOY


                  CODE                             

                                   JENKINS         OPERATE                            

                  BUILD 
      

                  TEST                             MONITOR 


VI] Why Jenkins is so popular 

    • Open Source 
    • Good Plugin Support 
    • Fast and Reliable
    • Goods OS Support 
    • Scripted Blinds

 Plugin Management in Jenkins 
  To have an extra finality 


                                                   Shows update to plugins already installed 

                       Update 

                                                   Shows Plugins the are available for installation 
 
                      Available 
                       
    Test                                            Display Plugins installed that have no updates

                     Installed

                                                   List configuration of http proxy allows manual upload of plugin and URL of plugin site 
                     Advanced


In real time we can not installed the plugins as simple as that reason being their might be challenges with proxy setting as well as VPN in order to avoid this we should configure http proxy in Jenkins plugins of advanced tag.
